ResultObject  List of Lists

resultList$dataName$data <- dataobject
resultList$dataName$type <- datatype (one of "row", "col", "assay", "meta", "contrastTop", "contrastTreat")

dataNames are arbitrary and assigned by the user
each dataName should have both a data element and a type element

assays must all have same dimensions: N rows (genes) by M columns (samples)
	e.g. counts, Log2CPM, TPM, FPKM, zFPKM, etc.

row data types must have N rows (e.g DGElist, voomElist, fit, gene annotation

col data types must have M rows (e.g. sample annotation (factors), sample-based alignment stats)

meta data type is a catch all for other types of data not keyed to either row or col data


Constrasts:

contrastTop is a special row structure.  Special only because we want to be able to extract all contrasts separately from other row data types. 
contrastTreat is a special meta structure. 

dataName is the name of the contrast (e.g. "disease_vs_control") and type is either "ContrastTop" or "ContrastTreat.
	

accessor functions:
add_result(resultList, dataName, dataObj, type)  returns resultList with new object added.
get_result(resultList, dataName) returns one item
print(resultList)  print list of dataNames and types and print workflowRecord if present.
"["	Define subsetting functions
get_type (resultList, type)  return a list of all one type of data (use to retrieve all contrasts to a contrast list).
