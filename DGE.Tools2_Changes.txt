DGE.Tools2 Changes

runVoom: 
	code reorganized for easier reading of the 6 senarios supported:
		simple voom
		voom with QW
		voom with QW & var.design
		simple voom & dupCor
		voom with QW & dupCor
		voom with QW & var.design & dupCor

	Input now is counts, designMatrix and formula to facilitate use if you don't have an RSE

BuildRSE:
	Just includes counts now
	added convertCounts function to get other values(FPKM, TPM, CPM, FPK and zFPKM)
	This avoids trying to put every derived datatype someone might want into the RSE.

convertCounts function:
	converts Counts to one of CPM, FPKM, TPM, zFPKM, FPK
	normalized or not
	logged or not
