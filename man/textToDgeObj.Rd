\arguments{
\item{path}{Path for the three data files (required).  For cloud, use s3fs to
mount a S3 bucket to a local folder path.}

\item{counts}{A matrix or dataframe of R genes by C samples (required)
[Default = "RNA-Seq.Count.Table.txt"]}

\item{seqAnnotation}{Gene, isoform or exon level (row) annotation (required)
[Default = "RNA-Seq.Count.Annotation.txt"]}

\item{design}{Sample annotation with expt factors and other sample-associated
data (required) [Default = RNA-Seq.Design.txt"]}

\item{level}{One of "gene", "isoform", "exon" (required)}

\item{customAttr}{A named list of custom attributes to attach to the DGEobj;
Optional but highly encouraged;  suggestions: list(PID = "20170101-0001",
XpressID = "123456", Genome = "Mouse.B38", GeneMobel = "Ensembl.R84") (optional)}

\item{gz}{Set to true to automatically add ".gz" to the default file names.  This
is a convenience for when the default files are gzipped.}

\item{verbose}{Output more info while reading data (Default = FALSE)}
}
\value{
A DGEobj

\description{
Builds a DGEobj from Omicsoft output files.  To read data directly from the
cloud, you'll need s3FS on mac/linux (https://github.com/s3fs-fuse/s3fs-fuse)
or CloudBerry Drive (commercial tool) on Windows. Using those tools you can
mount an S3 bucket to a local mountpoint and read the data directly from the
cloud. On Windows, it may be possible to use s3fs via cygwin (google it).  Of course,
this will work on any Omicsoft-format text files stored on the local file systems as well.
}
\details{
The input files may be gzipped, however, in that case you'll need to provide
the filenames in the "counts", "seqAnnotation" and "design" arguments.

Data Format Requirements:

This function is designed for Omicsoft output files typically found in the
ExportedViewsAndTables folders for each project.  Omicsoft project output is
typically found in the S3 location:
bmsrd-ngs-arrayserver/OmicsoftHome/output/<PID>/<OmicosoftProjectName>/ExportedViewsAndTables.

Count data should have rownames (sequence ids) and column names (sample IDs).
Sequence annotation should also have the same rownames as assays.

If possible, the sequence annotation should include chromosome position data (chr,
start, end, strand).

Sample annotation must have one row for each column in the count table.
rownames(sampleannotation) == colnames(counts).

Function DGEobj::annotateDGEobj provides an easier way than the customAttr argument
here.  annotateDGEobj reads key=value pairs from a text file to define
attributes.

For sequence annotation: The gene ID (Ensembl ID in our case) is used as the
rowname.  The following fields are also included: "GeneName" (GeneSymbol),
"Transcript." (transcript#), "Strand", "Chromosome", "Start", "End",
"ExonLength (sum of exons)", "Source" (Ensembl Source field), "IsConfounded"
(overlaps another gene).

Certain downstream functionality depends on specific seqeunce annotation
fields.  For example, Chromosome, Start, End and Strand are required to build
a genomicRanges object.  And many people depend on the source field to filter
for protein-coding genes.  So you can probably build a DGEobj with any old annotation file.
But minimally adhering to these columns of data will insure operability with downstream
tools.
