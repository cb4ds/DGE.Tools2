\title{Convert counts and geneLength to TPM units}
\usage{
tpm.direct(counts, geneLength, collapse = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{counts}{A numeric matrix of N genes x M samples. All columns must be numeric.}

\item{geneLength}{Numeric matrix of gene lengths. Often the ExonLength item of a DGEobj.}

\item{collapse}{Default = FALSE. TRUE or FALSE determines whether to use rowMeans on the geneLength matrix.}
}
\value{
A matrix of TPM values
}
\description{
Takes a counts and geneLength as input and converts to TPM units using the equation from
[Harold Pimental](https://haroldpimentel.wordpress.com/2014/05/08/what-the-fpkm-a-review-rna-seq-expression-units/).
}
\details{
The result should be the same as using convertCounts with normalize = 'tpm' and log = FALSE.

geneLength can be a vector (length == nrow(counts)) or a matrix (same dim as counts).
The geneLength is used as is, or optionally collapsed to a vector by rowMeans.
